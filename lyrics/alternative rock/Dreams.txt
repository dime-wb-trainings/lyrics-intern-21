Dance!
Whoo!
Brrrrt!
Oh, my life is changing everyday
In every possible way
And oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
(Never quite as it seems)
I know I felt like this before
But now I'm feeling it even more
Because it came from you
Then I open up and see
The person falling here is me
A different way to be
C'mon
La ah
La, ah, ah, ah
La, ah, ah, ah
La, ah, ah, ah
La ah ah ah
I want more, impossible to ignore
Impossible to ignore
(And they'll come true)
And they'll come true
Impossible not to do
Impossible not to do
And now I tell you openly
You have my heart, so don't hurt me
You're what I couldn't find
A totally amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me
Sing it for me!
1, 2, 3, 4
Oh, my life is changing everyday
In every possible way
(I said, oh, I said oh)
And oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
'Cause you're a dream to me
Dream to me
La, ah
La, ah, ah, ah
La, ah, ah
La ah ah ah
Sing on!
La, ah
La, ah, ah, ah
La, ah, ah
La ah ah ah
Oh oh oh
La ah
La ah ah ah ah
La ah ah ah
La ah ah ah
