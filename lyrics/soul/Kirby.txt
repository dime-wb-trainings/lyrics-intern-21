Mama told me never judge a man by the wallet
Mmm-mmh, keep talkin'
He can have a dollar but if he ain't got a pocket
Mmm-mmh, keep walkin'
Check the hood and the mileage, gotta-
Best drive 'fore you buy it, are ya
The entree or the side dish, gotta-
I gotta know what your vibe is and I-
Ain't tryna read your mind, oooh
Slow it down
If you drop it, can you pick it up?
Hold up, slow it down
If you drop it, can you pick it up?
Hold up, slow it down
I don't need no Henny
Down on the floor like a penny
Ooh, if you drop it, can you pick it up?
Mm, mmm, slow it down
Ay, mm, mm
Slow it down
Baby, mm, mm, is it-
Boy off beat lookin' like you need a sitter
Baby, don't come here with that rhythm
1, 2, 3, 6, and then 8
If you can't keep the bass
Then you can't keep the cake
I checked the hood and the mileage, gotta-
Best drive 'fore you buy it, are ya
The entree or the side dish, gotta-
I gotta know what your vibe is and I-
Ain't tryna read your mind, oooh
Slow it down
If you drop it, can you pick it up?
Mmm, slow it down
If you drop it, can you pick it up?
Mmm, slow it down
I don't need no Henny
Down on the floor like a penny
Ooh, if you drop it, can you pick it up?
Ay, ayy, slow it down
I don't need no help
(Can you be apart of my life?)
Groove by myself
(Put you on the passenger side)
If you come correct
(Baby don't be wasting my time)
You got the porcelain and it ain't even your birthday
Baby, you gotta slow it down
